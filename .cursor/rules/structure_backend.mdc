## Structure
Typescript code of the backend Node.js application is under /backend folder. 

- Organize code by architecture layers into the following packages: 
```
├── /src
│	├── /models          # Define the structure of the data (e.g., database schemas). 
│	├── /services         # Contain the business logic. 
│	├── /controllers     # Handle incoming HTTP requests.
│	├── /routes            # Define all the endpoints and link them to controllers. 
│	├── /middleware # Reusable functions that run before or after request handlers such as auth, error handling, etc.
│	├── /config            # Store configuration such as environment variables or DB settings.
│	├── /types             # Store the shared custom TypeScript type definitions and interfaces.
│	├── /utils               # Store the helper or utility functions.
│	└── /docs              # Store the OpenAPI specification of backend APIs.
└── /tests	       # Contains tests. 

```
- Inside `/models`, `/routes`, `/controllers`, `/services` folders, organize files by the following domains: users, groups, voting, and movies.
