## Structure
Kotlin code of the frontend Android application is under frontend/app/src/main/java/com/movieswipe. 

In this folder
- Use MVVM pattern to organize the code by architectural layers into the following packages: 
```
/app
├── /ui                         # Displays application data to the user and handles user interactions.
│   ├── /screens          # Contains the UI elements that render the data on the screen.
│   └── /viewModels    # Contains ViewModel classes that hold data, expose this data to the UI, and handle logic.
├── /data                     # Contains data used in the application.
│   ├── /local               # Data stored locally on the device.
│   ├── /remote           # Data fetched remotely (e.g., back-end API calls).
│   └── /repositories    # Contains the abstraction to interact with different sources of data.
└── /common              # Common helpers, utilities, constants, and extension functions shared across the app.
```

- Inside `/screens`, `/viewModels`, `/repositories` folders, organize files by the following domains: users, groups, voting, and movies.
