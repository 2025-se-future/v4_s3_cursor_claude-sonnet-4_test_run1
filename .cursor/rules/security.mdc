## Data Handling
- (Frontend+Backend) Validate and sanitize all inputs from external sources to prevent injection attacks.
- (Frontend+Backend) Never invoke shell commands with unsanitized strings.
- (Frontend+Backend) Store sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit.
- (Frontend+Backend) Avoid logging sensitive data; redact or hash sensitive data in logs.
- (Frontend+Backend) Use environment variables or a secure secrets manager for API keys and credentials.


## API and Network Security
- (Frontend+Backend) Use HTTPS for all API communications.
- (Backend) Handle CORS safely. 
- (Backend) Implement proper authentication and authorization.
- (Backend) Follow the principle of least privilege for API endpoints and DB access.
- (Backend) Implement rate limiting on backend APIs endpoints to prevent abuse.
- (Backend) Use secure defaults (e.g., TLSv1.2+, strong ciphers/protocols).


## Operational and Permission Boundaries
- (Frontend) Request only the minimum Android permissions needed.
- (Frontend and Backend) Isolate sensitive operations with explicit permission boundaries.


## Reliability and Security Resilience
- (Frontend+Backend) Apply retries, exponential backoff, and timeouts to all external calls, ensuring they donâ€™t bypass auth or duplicate sensitive actions.
